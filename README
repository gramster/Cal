*
* cal.c - an appointment/birthday/etc reminder utility
*
* Written by Graham Wheeler, December 1989
*
* This program may be freely copied, modified, distributed, etc,
* provided that this header comment is left intact, and that any
* enhancements are commented and credited.
*
* USAGE:
*	This program scans a file called `cal.dat' which should
*	contain a number of text lines. Each line should be of the
*	form `day/month text'; for example:
*
* 10/5 Graham Wheeler's birthday
*
*	The program takes an argument on the command line, which
*	is the number of days ahead that it should scan. All events
*	occuring within that number of days will be printed. The
*	program doesn't care about leap years, but does work
*	intelligently over month and year wraps. I use it in my
*	AUTOEXEC.BAT file to remind me of everything that is scheduled
*	for the next week.
*
*	Written in TurboC v2.0 under MS-DOS 3.3
